# seCrawler(Search Engine Crawler)
A scrapy project can crawl search result of Google/Bing/Baidu

## refer
copying by https://github.com/xtt129/seCrawler and rewrite,adding title and abstract.

## prerequisite
python 3.5 and scrapy is needed.


## commands

run one command to get 50 pages result from search engine with keyword, the result would be kept in the "urls.txt" under the current directory.


####Bing
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=bing -a pages=50```

####Baidu
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=baidu -a pages=50```

####Google
```scrapy crawl keywordSpider -a keyword=Spider-Man -a se=google -a pages=50```

## results
url,title and abstract will be stored in the urls.txt
## limitation
The project doesn't provide any workaround to the anti-spider measure like CAPTCHA, IP ban list, etc. 

But to reduce these measures, we recommand to set ```DOWNLOAD_DELAY=10``` in settings.py file to add a temporisation (in second) between the crawl of two pages, see details in [Scrapy Setting](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.2/topics/settings.html#std:setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY).
